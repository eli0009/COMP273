# Loops and if else in MIPS assembly

## branch commands

See [if else example](mips2.asm)

| command               | action                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `j label`             | jump to label                        |
| `beq $s0, $s1, label` | jump to label if `$s0 equals to $s1` |
| `slt $t0, $t1, $t2`   | set `$t0` to 1 if `$t1 < $t2` else 0 |
| `slti $t0, $t1, 16`   | same but for immediate               |

beq and slt have many variations for `>, <, ==`, as well as unsigned (add u at the end of slt)
