# Procedures

## MIPS functions calls
See [mips6.asm](mips6.asm)

Use `jal label` command for jumping, and jump back using `jr $ra`
Remember to add the following at the end of main label, otherwise there will be an infinite loop!
```nasm
li $v0, 10 
syscall
```
## Stack
See [misp7.asm](mips7.asm)

### push
Get next empty space by decreasing `$sp` by 4 with `addi`, then push to stack using `sw`.

### pop
load content from stack with `lw`, then increase `$sp` by 4 with `addi`

## nested function call

See [the sum of square function](mipsSquareOfSum.asm)

Store `$ra` into stack so when they get overwritten you can just load it from the stack

## register convention

Preserved registers should be first pushed onto a stack if you need to overwrite them.


| register address | usage              | preserved |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| $t               | temporary variable | no        |
| $s               | save variable      | yes       |
| $a               | function argument  | no        |
| $v               | function return    | no        |
| $sp              | stack pointer      | yes       |
| $ra              | return address     | yes       |
