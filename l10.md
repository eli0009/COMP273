# Procedures

## MIPS functions calls
See [mips6.asm](mips6.asm)

Use `jal label` command for jumping, and jump back using `jr $ra`
Remember to add the following at the end of main label, otherwise there will be an infinite loop!
```nasm
li $v0, 10 
syscall
```
## Stack
See [misp7.asm](mips7.asm)

### push
Get next empty space by decreasing `$sp` by 4 with `addi`, then push to stack using `sw`.

### pop
load content from stack with `lw`, then increase `$sp` by 4 with `addi`
