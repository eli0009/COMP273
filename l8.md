Important commands

| command         | action                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `li $s1`        | assign value to address                                                                      |
| `la $s1 x`      | load .asciiz label into address (for printing) or for loading array into register            |
| `lw $t2 8($t1)` | load value stored at index 2 of array (starting from 0 increment by 4)                       |
| `sw $t2 8($t1)` | store value to index 2 of array                                                              |
| `sw $t2 x($t1)` | store value to address x + `$t1` (if `$t1` is 4, that corresponds to 2nd element in array x) |

Other commands: add, addi, sub, move, 

## Compiling C assignment using registers


`f = (g+h) - (i+j)` where 

| variable | register |
| -------- | -------- |
| f        | $0       |
| g        | $1       |
| h        | $2       |
| i        | $3       |
| j        | $4       |

2 temporary variables: `$t0, $t1`

```nasm
add $t0, $1, $2
add $t1, $3, $4
add $1, $t0, $t1
```

## Compiling assignment when operand is in memory

`g = h + A[8]` where `A` is an array of 100 words and:

| variable | register          |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| g        | $s1               |
| h        | $s2               |
| A        | $s3 (base adress) |

```nasm
lw $t0, 8 ($s3) # The address is the sum of the base of array A (found in register $s3) and the number to select (element 8)
add $s1, $s2, $t0 # g = h + A[8]
```
- Offset: The constant in data transfer instruction (8)
- Base register: the register added to form the address ($s3)

## Hardware interface

Virtually all architectures today address individual bytes (8-bit), so each MIPS address differ by 4 (ex: the byte adress of the third word is 8)
