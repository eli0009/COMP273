# Compiling C assignment using registers

`f = (g+h) - (i+j)` where 

variable | register
--|--
f | $0
g|$1
h|$2
i|$3
j|$4

2 temporary variables: `$t0, $t1`

```nasm
add $t0, $1, $2
add $t1, $3, $4
add $1, $t0, $t1
```

# Compiling assignment when operand is in memory

`g = h + A[8]` where `A` is an array of 100 words and:

variable | register
--|--
g|$s1
h|$s2
A | $s3 (base adress)

```nasm
lw $t0, 8 ($s3) # The address is the sum of the base of array A (found in register $s3) and the number to select (element 8)
add $s1, $s2, $t0 # g = h + A[8]
```
- Offset: The constant in data transfer instruction (8)
- Base register: the register added to form the address ($s3)

# Hardware interface

Virtually all architectures today address individual bytes (8-bit), so each MIPS address differ by 4 (ex: the byte adress of the third word is 8)
